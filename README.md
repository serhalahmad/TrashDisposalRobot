## Description
Our system will search the place around for a box to go and throw the trash in it. The mechatronic system consists of a robotic arm that is mounted on a rover. The
robotic arm is responsible for capturing the ball and throwing it. In the front of the rover, there
is a camera that is used to detect the box and the distance to that box. We also have 2 fuzzy
logic controllers, one is responsible for controlling the rotation speed of the motors, and the
other is responsible for controlling the forward motion speed of the motors.
